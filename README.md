# `lunatic-diesel`

A collection of Diesel Backends and Connections that enable the usage of various sql databases with the Diesel ORM.
The crate re-exports all of diesel and is therefore to be used as a replacement for diesel and should be used under
the name `diesel` in the dependencies

An example of using it with SQLite is provided here:
https://github.com/SquattingSocrates/sqlite-lunatic-diesel-example

Currently supported databases:

- [x] SQLite
- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] MySQL


## Usage
Steps to use this library:

- install [lunatic](https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic)
- install [diesel cli](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/diesel_cli) + the cli dependencies for your database of choice
- create a new rust project
- add [lunatic-diesel](https://github.com/SquattingSocrates/lunatic-diesel) as dependency, but use it under the name of `diesel` like this: `diesel = {package = "lunatic-diesel", version = "0.1.0"}` or else some of the features of diesel will not work properly
- create a migration with `diesel migration generate`
- start building your app
